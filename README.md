# Competitive Programming Solutions

This project contains solutions to various competitive programming problems from platforms like Codeforces. Each solution is implemented in Java.

## Files

- `CF4A.java`: Solution to the problem of determining if a given weight \( w \) can be split into two even parts.
- `CF71A.java`: Solution to the problem of abbreviating long words.
- `CFA1.java`: Solution to the problem of calculating the number of flagstones needed to cover a rectangular area.

## How to Run

1. **Compile the Java files**:
    ```sh
    javac CF4A.java CF71A.java CFA1.java
    ```

2. **Run the desired program**:
    ```sh
    java CF4A
    java CF71A
    java CFA1
    ```

## Problem Descriptions

### CF4A - Watermelon
- **Input**: An integer \( w \) representing the weight of the watermelon.
- **Output**: "YES" if the weight can be split into two even parts, otherwise "NO".

### CF71A - Way Too Long Words
- **Input**: An integer \( n \) followed by \( n \) words.
- **Output**: Each word is printed in abbreviated form if its length is greater than 10, otherwise the word is printed as is.

### CFA1 - Theatre Square
- **Input**: Three integers \( n \), \( m \), and \( a \) representing the dimensions of the square and the size of the flagstone.
- **Output**: The number of flagstones needed to cover the entire area.
